ModelarDB is an efficient high-performance time series management system that is designed to efficiently ingest,
transfer, store, and analyze high-frequency time series across the edge and cloud. It provides state-of-the-art
lossless compression, lossy compression, and query performance by efficiently compressing time series on the edge
using multiple different types of models such as constant and linear functions. As a result, the high-frequency time
series can be transferred to the cloud through a connection with very limited bandwidth and stored in the cloud at
a low cost. The compressed time series can be efficiently queried on both the edge and in the cloud using a relational
interface and SQL without any knowledge about the model-based representation. A query optimizer automatically rewrites
the queries to exploit the model-based representation.

ModelarDB is designed to be cross-platform and is currently automatically tested on Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Ubuntu
through [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/ModelarData/ModelarDB-RS/actions). It is also known to work on FreeBSD which
is [currently not supported by GitHub Actions](https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/385). It is implemented in
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and uses [Apache Arrow Flight](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/tree/master/arrow-flight)
for communicating with clients, [Apache Arrow DataFusion](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion) as its query
engine, [Apache Arrow](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs) as its in-memory data format, and
[Apache Parquet](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/tree/master/parquet) as its on-disk data format.

ModelarDB intentionally does not gather usage data. So, all users are highly encouraged to post comments, suggestions,
and bugs as GitHub issues, especially if a limitation of ModelarDB prevents it from being used in a particular domain.

## Installation
Refer to the [Installation](docs/user/README.md#installation) section of the [User](docs/user/README.md) documentation
for installation instructions on setting up ModelarDB on four major operating systems. To easily experiment with
ModelarDB, instructions for setting up a [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) environment are included in the
[Docker](docs/user/README.md#docker) section.

## Usage
Usage instructions for running a server, ingesting data, and querying data using ModelarDB are included in the
[Usage](docs/user/README.md#usage) section of the [User](docs/user/README.md) documentation.

## Development
Refer to the [Development](docs/dev/README.md) section of the documentation for an overview of the structure of the
project, a detailed description of each major component, and an outline of the guidelines that should be adhered
to when contributing to the project.

## Research-Based
A deprecated JVM-based prototype of ModelarDB was developed as part of a [research project](https://github.com/skejserjensen/ModelarDB)
at Aalborg University and later as an [open-source project](https://github.com/ModelarData/ModelarDB). While the
deprecated JVM-based prototype validated the benefits of using a model-based representation for time series, it
has been superseded by this current, much more efficient, Rust-based implementation.
