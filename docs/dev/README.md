# ModelarDB Development
This document describes the structure of the code and general considerations to consider when doing further development.
As such, this document should be used as a guideline when contributing to the repository.

Contributions to all aspects of ModelarDB are highly appreciated and do not need to be in the form of code.
For example, contributions can be:

- Helping other users.
- Writing documentation.
- Testing features and reporting bugs.
- Writing unit tests and integration tests.
- Fixing bugs in existing functionality.
- Refactoring existing functionality.
- Implementing new functionality.

Any questions or discussions regarding a possible contribution should be posted in the appropriate GitHub issue if
one exists, e.g., the bug report if it is a bugfix, and as a new GitHub issue otherwise.

## Structure
The ModelarDB project consists of the following crates:

- [modelardb_client](/crates/modelardb_client) - ModelarDB's command-line client in the form of the binary `modelardb`.
- [modelardb_common](/crates/modelardb_common) - Library providing shared functions, macros, and types for use by the other crates.
- [modelardb_compression](/crates/modelardb_compression) - Library providing lossless and lossy model-based compression of time series.
- [modelardb_server](/crates/modelardb_server) - The ModelarDB server in the form of the binary `modelardbd`.
- [modelardb_manager](/crates/modelardb_manager) - The ModelarDB manager in the form of the binary `modelardbm`.

## Components
Each major component in the ModelarDB server is described to support further development of the components
and ease integration between components.

The ModelarDB server consists of the following major components:
- **Arrow Flight API** - Provides a public interface to interact with the ModelarDB server.
- **Storage Engine** - Manages all uncompressed and compressed data in the ModelarDB server.
- **Compression** - Implements functionality for compressing time-series data using model-based compression.
- **Query Engine** - Provides functionality for querying data that is ingested by the ModelarDB server.
- **Metadata Manager** - Provides an interface to interact with the metadata database that contains information about the 
database schema and compressed data.
- **Configuration Manager** - Manages the configuration of the ModelarDB server and provides functionality for updating the 
configuration.

Furthermore, ModelarDB also includes a manager that is responsible for administering a cluster of ModelarDB server nodes 
and providing a consistent database schema. The manager also links external components, such as the metadata database 
and the object store for compressed data, to the ModelarDB server nodes to ensure access to external components is 
consistent.

The ModelarDB manager consists of the following major components:
- **Arrow Flight API** - Provides a public interface to interact with the ModelarDB manager.
- **Cluster Manager** - Manages all edge and cloud nodes currently controlled by the ModelarDB manager and provides 
functionality for balancing query workloads between multiple cloud nodes.
- **Metadata Manager** - Provides an interface to interact with the metadata database that contains information about 
the manager itself, the nodes controlled by the manager, and the database schema and compressed data in the cluster.

## Development
All code must be formatted according to the [Rust Style Guide](https://github.com/rust-dev-tools/fmt-rfcs/blob/master/guide/guide.md)
using [rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt). Subjects not covered in the style guide, or requirements specific
to this repository, are covered here.

### Documentation
All public and private functions must have an accompanying doc comment that describes the purpose of the function. For
complex functions, the doc comment should also include a description of each parameter, the return value,
and, if beneficial, examples.

All modules must have an accompanying doc comment that describes the general functionality of the module. A brief
description of the public functions, structs, enums, or other central elements of the module can be included.

### Testing and Linting
All public and private functions must be appropriately covered by unit tests. Full coverage is intended, which means all
branches of computation within each function should be thoroughly tested.

In addition, the following commands must not return any warnings or errors for the code currently in main:
- [cargo build --all-targets](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-build.html)
- [cargo clippy --all-targets](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy)
- [cargo doc](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-doc.html)
- [cargo machete --with-metadata](https://github.com/bnjbvr/cargo-machete)
- [cargo test --all-targets](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-test.html)

includes crates used for purposes such as logging, where multiple crates provide similar functionality.
