//! Implementation of lossless compression for timestamps. Optimized compression
//! methods are used depending on the number of data points in a compressed
//! segment and if its timestamps have been sampled at a regular sampling
//! interval.
//!
//! If a segment only contains one data point its timestamp is stored as both
//! the segment's `start_time` and `end_time`, and if a segment only contains
//! two data points the timestamps are stored as the segment's `start_time` and
//! `end_time`, respectively. If a segment contains more than two data points,
//! the first and last timestamps are stored as the segment's `start_time` and
//! `end_time`, respectively, while its residual timestamps are compressed using
//! one of two methods. If the data points in the segment have been collected at
//! a regular sampling interval, the residual timestamps are compressed as the
//! segment's length with the prefix zero bits stripped. If none of the above
//! apply, the compression method proposed for timestamps for the time series
//! management system Gorilla in the [Gorilla paper] is used as a fallback.
//!
